		<p>
			This license is subject to the following restrictions:
		</p>
		
		<ol type="a">
			<li>
				The Program may not be used for commercial or milatary purposes.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Every disribution of the Program must retain a copy of this Licence.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				The Program may not be sold or incorporated into any product which is sold 
				without prior permission from the Author. Distribution of the Program or 
				any work based on the Program by a commercial organization to any third party 
				without permission is prohibited if any payment is made in connection with 
				such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for a copy of the Program) 
				or indirectly (as in payment for some service related to the Program, or 
				payment for some product or service that includes a copy of the Program "without 
				charge").				  
			</li>
			
			<li>
				Any output produced through the use of the Program, or derived from, is subject 
				to this license, i.e. content made by running the Program may be freely distributed 
				provided that no direct or indirect payment is required by the distributor in exchange 
				of this content. Distribution of produced content must also follow the rules that may
				govern distribution and exploitation of the input material and/or the software that 
				generated.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				You must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any
				work that you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is
				derived from the Program (the "Work"):

					<li>
						You must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no
						charge to all third parties under the terms of this License;
					</li>
					
					<li>
						If the Work normally reads commands interactively when run,
						you must cause it, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or
						display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice. Such 
						notice must also state that users may redistribute the Work only under the 
						conditions of this License and tell the user how to view the copy of this 
						License included with the Work. If the Work is interactive but normally 
						prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of a user, such
						as in an "About box", the Work is only required to print or display the 
						notice under the same circumstances.
					</li>
					
					<li>
						If you distribute any written or printed material at all with
						the Work, such material must include either a written copy of this License,
