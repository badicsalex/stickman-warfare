## Info
This is the main code for the now old Delphi game Stickman Warfare (available at http://stickman.hu ). The code was originally imported from svn.stickman.hu, and it is no longer maintained there.

Please keep in mind that this is very old code, I (Alex) was like 17-19, when I made the main parts, and TBH, the code really sucks. It is only here for historic and educational purposes.
