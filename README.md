## Info
This is the main code for the now old Delphi game Stickman Warfare (available at http://stickman.hu). The code was originally imported from svn.stickman.hu, and it is no longer maintained there.

Please keep in mind that this is very old code, I (Alex) was like 17-19, when I made the main parts, and TBH, the code really sucks. It is only here for historic and educational purposes.

Special thanks to people who kept the project alive and developed it further after I stopped doing it:
- Ádám Háda
- Bertalan Göller
- Zoltán Farkas
- "Was"
